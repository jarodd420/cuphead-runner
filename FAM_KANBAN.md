## Backlog / To do

- [ ] *(Add items below from Slack feedback or manually)*

- [ ] (from jared rodriguez) the tap to download is a nice feature. i think when you are in that view if you tap the picture again it sjould be the equivalent of a cancel

- [ ] (from jared rodriguez) on the feed remove the moment type icon from the list. it takes up real estate and doesnt provide value

- [ ] (from Meg) Capability to tap on profile picture and edit it

- [ ] (from Meg) Be able to tap on someone else’s profile picture and see a bigger photo

- [ ] (from jared rodriguez) when you click a picture and are in the download mode it would be nice to be able to pinch zoom in and out also
